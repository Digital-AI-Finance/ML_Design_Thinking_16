# Handout 1: Basic AI Ethics Checklist
## For Beginners

### Before Building an AI System

**Purpose Check:**
- [ ] Is there a real need for this AI system?
- [ ] Have we considered non-AI alternatives?
- [ ] Can we explain the value to stakeholders?

**People Check:**
- [ ] Who will be affected by this system?
- [ ] Have we talked to users and affected communities?
- [ ] Who might be harmed?

**Data Check:**
- [ ] Do we know where our data came from?
- [ ] Do we have permission to use this data?
- [ ] Is our data representative of all users?
- [ ] Have we checked for obvious biases in the data?

### During Development

**Fairness Check:**
- [ ] Have we tested performance across different groups?
- [ ] Are error rates similar for all groups?
- [ ] Have we documented any performance differences?

**Transparency Check:**
- [ ] Can we explain how the system makes decisions?
- [ ] Have we documented what data we use?
- [ ] Is it clear to users that AI is being used?

**Safety Check:**
- [ ] What happens if the system makes a mistake?
- [ ] Have we tested edge cases?
- [ ] Is there a human review process?

### Before Deployment

**Review Check:**
- [ ] Has someone outside the team reviewed the system?
- [ ] Have we tested with real users?
- [ ] Do we have a plan for monitoring after launch?

**Documentation Check:**
- [ ] Have we created a model card?
- [ ] Are limitations clearly documented?
- [ ] Do users know how to report problems?

**Legal Check:**
- [ ] Have we checked relevant regulations (GDPR, AI Act)?
- [ ] Do we have proper consent from data subjects?
- [ ] Have we consulted legal counsel?

### After Deployment

**Monitoring Check:**
- [ ] Are we tracking system performance regularly?
- [ ] Have we set up alerts for problems?
- [ ] Are we collecting user feedback?

**Response Check:**
- [ ] Do we have a process for handling complaints?
- [ ] Can users appeal AI decisions?
- [ ] Are we fixing identified problems quickly?

### Red Flags (STOP if any of these are true)

- **No** - We don't know who provided our training data
- **No** - We haven't tested performance across different demographic groups
- **No** - We can't explain how the system makes decisions
- **No** - There's no human oversight for high-stakes decisions
- **No** - We have no plan for monitoring after deployment
- **No** - We don't have user consent for data usage
- **No** - The system makes decisions that significantly affect people's lives without review

### Quick Terminology

- **Bias**: Systematic errors that favor certain groups over others
- **Fairness**: Treating similar people similarly
- **Transparency**: Being open about how AI systems work
- **Accountability**: Clear responsibility for AI outcomes
- **Model Card**: A document describing an AI model's capabilities and limitations
