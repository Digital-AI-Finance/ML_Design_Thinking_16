# Handout 1: Getting Started with AI Prototyping (Basic Level)

## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI creates new content - text, images, code, audio - based on patterns learned from existing data. Think of it as a creative assistant that can help you prototype ideas faster.

### Common Generative AI Tools

1. **ChatGPT/Claude** - Text generation, brainstorming, writing
2. **DALL-E/Midjourney** - Image creation from text descriptions
3. **GitHub Copilot** - Code writing assistant
4. **Canva AI** - Design automation

## Your First AI Prototype: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Define Your Goal
- What problem are you solving?
- Who is your target user?
- What would success look like?

### Step 2: Choose Your Tool
- **For text/ideas**: ChatGPT (free tier available)
- **For images**: Bing Image Creator (free with Microsoft account)
- **For design**: Canva (free tier with AI features)

### Step 3: Write Your First Prompt
```
Bad Prompt: "Make a logo"

Good Prompt: "Create a minimalist logo for a sustainable
coffee shop called 'Green Bean' using earth tones and a
coffee plant leaf icon"
```

### Step 4: Iterate and Refine
- Generate 5-10 variations
- Combine the best elements
- Refine with more specific prompts

## Practical Exercise: 30-Minute Product Concept

### Materials Needed
- Computer with internet
- Free ChatGPT account
- Free Canva account

### Task
Create a mobile app concept for helping students manage study time.

### Process
1. **Brainstorm (5 min)**
   - Ask ChatGPT: "Generate 5 innovative features for a student time management app"

2. **Develop Concept (10 min)**
   - Pick the best 3 features
   - Ask for detailed descriptions

3. **Create Visuals (10 min)**
   - Use Canva AI to generate app mockup
   - Create simple logo

4. **Write Description (5 min)**
   - Generate app store description with ChatGPT

## Tips for Success

### DO:
- Start simple
- Try multiple variations
- Combine AI output with your ideas
- Always review and edit AI content
- Save your prompts for reuse

### DON'T:
- Accept first output as final
- Use AI content without review
- Ignore ethical considerations
- Share sensitive data

## Common Beginner Mistakes

1. **Vague Prompts** → Be specific!
2. **No Iteration** → Always generate multiple versions
3. **Blind Trust** → Always fact-check AI outputs
4. **Over-complexity** → Start with simple tasks
