## Purpose

This folder was created during the initial course development (Aug-Sep 2025) to:
1. Plan the 10-week course structure
2. Create overview presentations
3. Develop visualization scripts for charts
4. Test layout templates

## Relationship to Active Course

The active course content is in the `Week_01/` through `Week_10/` folders at the repository root. This folder contains planning and support materials, not the final course presentations.

## Key Files

- **course_overview_10week.tex**: High-level course structure presentation
- **full_course_content_toc.md**: Detailed table of contents for all weeks
- **power_charts_scripts.md**: Documentation for chart generation scripts

## Status

This folder is being maintained for reference. See NEEDS_REVIEW.md for pending analysis tasks.
