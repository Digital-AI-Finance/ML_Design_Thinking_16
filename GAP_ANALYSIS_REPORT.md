## RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Core Structure (Week 1)
- [ ] Create Week 3 complete implementation as template
- [ ] Develop modular structure with 5 parts
- [ ] Generate 15 charts with scripts
- [ ] Write 3 handouts
- [ ] Add compile.py and README

### Phase 2: Replication (Weeks 2-4)
- [ ] Apply Week 3 template to Week 4-6
- [ ] Maintain consistent modular structure
- [ ] Generate topic-specific visualizations
- [ ] Create corresponding handouts

### Phase 3: Advanced Topics (Weeks 5-8)
- [ ] Implement Week 7-10 with enhanced content
- [ ] Add mathematical appendices
- [ ] Include industry case studies
- [ ] Develop practice exercises

### Phase 4: Assessment & Polish (Week 9)
- [ ] Create all assessment materials
- [ ] Add Jupyter notebooks for interactivity
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Final quality assurance pass

## COMPLETION METRICS

### Minimum Viable Course (MVC)
- All lecture slides (Week 1-10)
- Basic charts and visualizations
- compile.py for all weeks
- README documentation

**Estimated effort: 170 hours**

### Standard Course
- MVC + All handouts
- Practice exercises
- Mathematical appendices
- Basic assessments

**Estimated effort: 280 hours**

### Premium Course
- Standard + Jupyter notebooks
- Industry case studies
- Complete assessment suite
- Student handbook

**Estimated effort: 420+ hours**

---

## RISK FACTORS

1. **Time Constraint**: 420+ hours is significant effort
2. **Content Depth**: Advanced topics (Week 6-10) require expertise
3. **Quality Consistency**: Maintaining standards across all weeks
4. **Technical Complexity**: Some visualizations are computationally intensive
5. **Assessment Design**: Creating fair, meaningful evaluations

---

## CONCLUSION

The course is approximately **25% complete** with excellent foundation in Week 0-2. The primary gap is Week 3-10 implementation, requiring an estimated 420+ hours to reach full completion. 

**Recommendation**: Focus on Minimum Viable Course (170 hours) first, then incrementally add enhanced features.
