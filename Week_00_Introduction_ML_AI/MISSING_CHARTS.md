## Chart Creation Priority
1. **High Priority** (Essential for presentation flow):
   - ml_pipeline.pdf
   - linear_regression_comparison.pdf
   - logistic_regression.pdf
   - kmeans_clustering.pdf
   - perceptron_model.pdf
   - gan_architecture.pdf
   - transformer_architecture.pdf

2. **Medium Priority** (Enhance understanding):
   - decision_tree.pdf
   - random_forest.pdf
   - pca_analysis.pdf
   - mlp_architecture.pdf
   - activation_functions.pdf
   - vae_architecture.pdf

3. **Low Priority** (Supplementary):
   - All remaining charts

## Notes
- All charts should follow WCAG AAA color palette
- Use 0.85\textwidth scaling consistently
- Include both PDF and PNG versions
- Charts should be professional and educational quality
