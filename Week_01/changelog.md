# Changelog - Week 1 Materials

## 2025-09-14 17:00 - Expanded Discovery Worksheet with Pipeline Exercises

### Updated Version
- **File**: `week01_discovery_worksheet.tex`
- **PDF**: `week01_discovery_worksheet_expanded.pdf` (9 pages, 124KB)

### Major Additions
- Added 3 new exercises focused on ML and Design Thinking pipelines
- Expanded from 5 to 9 pages total
- More academic, formal approach

### New Exercises Added
1. **Exercise 3: Technical Process Sequencing**
   - Students arrange ML pipeline stages in correct order
   - Data → Preprocess → Model → Evaluate → Deploy
   - Questions about sequential dependencies

2. **Exercise 4: Human-Centered Process Sequencing**
   - Students arrange Design Thinking stages
   - Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test
   - Questions about iteration and bidirectional flow

3. **Exercise 5: Methodological Integration**
   - Shows both pipelines in parallel
   - Students identify connections between stages
   - Analysis of how technical and human processes inform each other

### Enhanced Reflection
- Renamed to "Methodological Synthesis"
- Added academic questions about:
  - Epistemological differences
  - Process rigidity vs flexibility
  - Quantitative/qualitative complementarity
  - Automation potential

## 2025-09-14 16:30 - Discovery Worksheet (Academic Style)

### Created New Version
- **File**: `week01_discovery_worksheet.tex`
- **PDF**: `week01_discovery_worksheet.pdf` (5 pages, 102KB)

### Complete Redesign
- **Purpose**: Professional, neutral pre-lesson worksheet
- **Style**: Academic worksheet, minimal design
- **Approach**: Discovery through frustration with manual sorting

### Key Features
- **Ultra-neutral layout** - No colors except black/gray
- **No decorative elements** - Clean, serious, academic
- **Aligned with lecture** - Connects directly to Part 1 Foundation
- **Builds natural curiosity** - Shows limitations of manual sorting

### Structure (4 content pages + title)
1. **Title Page** - Simple, professional
2. **Exercise 1** - Sort 100 dots manually
3. **Exercise 2** - Categorize 30 innovations
4. **Reflection** - Why automation matters

### Design Philosophy
- Let students discover the need for ML naturally
- Focus on the frustration of manual pattern finding
- No technical terms or ML jargon
- Questions that lead to "aha" moments
- Direct connection to lecture content (270 features, scale problems)

## 2025-09-14 16:00 - Pre-Lesson Discovery Handout

### Created New Version
- **File**: `week01_discovery_handout_prelession.tex`
- **PDF**: `week01_discovery_handout_prelession.pdf` (5 pages, 267KB)

### Improvements Over Previous Versions
- Designed specifically for use BEFORE the first lesson
- Questions that make sense without any ML knowledge
- Removed name/date fields from cover
- More guided discovery approach

### Structure (5 pages)
1. **Cover** - Clean design with visual transformation preview
2. **Discovery 1** - "Do You See the Groups?" using chaos_to_clarity.pdf
3. **Discovery 2** - "Things That Belong Together" using simple_clustering_intro.pdf
4. **Discovery 3** - "Same Dots, Different Stories" using beginner_algorithm_comparison.pdf
5. **Reflection** - "What You Noticed" with concrete questions

### Better Questions
- Replaced abstract concepts with concrete observations
- Added multiple choice and checkboxes for easier engagement
- Included real comparisons (sorting 1000 dots by hand)
- Questions build from simple observation to insight

### Charts Used
- `chaos_to_clarity.pdf` - Shows transformation from random to organized
- `simple_clustering_intro.pdf` - Basic pattern discovery
- `beginner_algorithm_comparison.pdf` - Different perspectives on same data

## 2025-09-14 15:30 - Simplified Discovery Handout

### Created New Version
- **File**: `week01_discovery_handout_simplified.tex`
- **PDF**: `week01_discovery_handout_simplified.pdf` (6 pages, 177KB)

### Major Changes from Enhanced Version

#### Color Reduction
- **Before**: 8 colors (blue, orange, green, red, purple, gray, yellow, cyan)
- **After**: 3 colors only (primary blue, secondary gray, accent orange)

#### Content Simplification
- **Before**: 8 different exercises across 10 pages
- **After**: 3 focused discovery exercises across 6 pages

#### Removed Elements
- All unverified statistics and numbers
- Company names and case studies
- Mathematical formulas and calculations
- Time limits ("3 minutes" etc.)
- Industry examples with specific metrics

#### Added Elements
- 3 actual ML visualization charts:
  - `clustering_examples.pdf` - for pattern discovery
  - `distance_visual.pdf` - for similarity understanding
  - `clustering_methods_comparison.pdf` - for algorithm comparison
- Pure discovery-based learning approach
- Visual observation exercises

### Structure
1. Cover page - simplified design
2. Discovery 1 - Pattern Recognition
3. Discovery 2 - Understanding Similarity  
4. Discovery 3 - Different Tools, Different Patterns
5. Create Your Own - Drawing exercise
6. Reflection - Key discoveries
