## Summary

**ALL PLAN REQUIREMENTS SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED**

The worksheet has been expanded from 5 to 9 pages with three new exercises focusing on:
1. ML Pipeline understanding (technical sequencing)
2. Design Thinking Pipeline understanding (human-centered iteration)
3. Pipeline Convergence (methodological integration)

The enhanced reflection page includes all 6 academic questions as specified, including the epistemological comparison between "Model" and "Ideate".

The visual design maintains strict monochrome palette, uses only geometric shapes, and follows academic conventions throughout.
