## COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS

### ✅ Priority 1: CRITICAL FIXES (100% Complete)

#### Visual Content Issues - FULLY RESOLVED
Created 6 high-quality innovation-focused charts:
1. **innovation_patterns_visual.pdf** - Market segments with innovation opportunities
2. **innovation_archetypes.pdf** - Five distinct innovation types discovery
3. **innovation_pattern_maps.pdf** - Four perspectives on innovation categories
4. **opportunity_zones.pdf** - Market landscape and white space identification
5. **innovation_adjacencies.pdf** - Innovation synergy network graph
6. **opportunity_heatmap.pdf** - Innovation scoring across dimensions

#### Content Consistency - FULLY RESOLVED
- Removed Spotify case study reference (line 948)
- Changed "Empathize" to "Discover" in course journey
- Verified all terminology is innovation-focused (not user-centric)
- Confirmed "archetype creation" terminology throughout

### ✅ Priority 2: STRUCTURE & TECHNICAL (50% Complete)

#### Completed Priority 2 Items:
1. **Algorithm Comparison Table** - Added comprehensive comparison of K-means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical, GMM
2. **Decision Tree Diagram** - Interactive flowchart for choosing clustering method
3. **Python Code Snippets** - Added ready-to-use code examples in appendix
4. **Evaluation Metrics Comparison** - Visual comparison of Silhouette, Davies-Bouldin, Calinski-Harabasz
5. **Algorithm Selection Guide** - Decision paths with criteria

## CONCLUSION

The Week 1 slides have been successfully transformed from a draft with missing content to a comprehensive, professional presentation ready for immediate teaching use. All critical issues have been resolved, and significant pedagogical enhancements have been added. The presentation now effectively teaches clustering concepts through an innovation lens with complete visual support and practical implementation guidance.

**The slides are ready for production use** while remaining open for future Priority 3-5 enhancements as time permits.
