# DUPLICATE FOLDER - DO NOT USE

## Status
This folder is a **DUPLICATE** that was created in error.

## Active Version
Use **Week_00d_Neural_Networks/** instead.

## Contents
- Empty handouts/ folder only
- No actual content

## Why This Exists
This appears to be an incomplete copy or abandoned template created during course development. The active version contains full slides, charts, scripts, and handouts.

## Recommendation
Do not add content here. Use Week_00d_Neural_Networks/ for all neural network content.
