    FinTech User Behavior Dataset
    =============================

    Dataset for demonstrating advanced clustering techniques
    Designed for MSc-level machine learning education

    Size: 10,000 users
    Features: 12 behavioral and transactional metrics
    Segments: 7 (including fraudulent and noise)

    Segments:
    - Digital Natives (25%): Tech-savvy heavy users
    - Traditional Savers (20%): Conservative, high deposits
    - Business Users (15%): High volume, business hours
    - International Travelers (10%): Cross-border focus
    - Cautious Beginners (25%): New users, learning phase
    - Fraudulent (3%): Anomalous patterns for outlier detection
    - Noise (2%): Random patterns

    Features:
    1. transaction_frequency: Daily average transactions
    2. transaction_volume: Monthly total in USD
    3. session_duration: Average app usage in minutes
    4. payment_diversity: Number of different payment types (1-10)
    5. international_activity: Cross-border transaction ratio (0-1)
    6. savings_behavior: Deposit frequency score (0-100)
    7. credit_utilization: Credit line usage percentage (0-100)
    8. support_contacts: Monthly customer service interactions
    9. device_switches: Multi-device usage score (0-10)
    10. peak_hour_usage: Business hours activity ratio (0-1)
    11. merchant_categories: Spending category diversity (1-20)
    12. account_age: Days since registration

    Clustering Challenges:
    - Varying cluster densities
    - Overlapping segments (GMM suitable)
    - Outliers and anomalies (DBSCAN suitable)
    - Natural hierarchy (Hierarchical suitable)
    - Different cluster shapes
    - Missing values (2% in some features)
    - Temporal correlations
    - Skewed distributions
