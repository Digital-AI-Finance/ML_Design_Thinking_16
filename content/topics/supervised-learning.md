# Supervised Learning

Learning from labeled examples to make predictions on new data.

## Overview

Supervised learning is the most common machine learning paradigm, where models learn from input-output pairs to predict outcomes for unseen data.

## Key Concepts

### Regression
- Predicting continuous values
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
- Model evaluation metrics (MSE, R-squared)

### Classification
- Predicting discrete categories
- Logistic regression basics
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)

### The Learning Process
1. Training on labeled data
2. Model parameter optimization
3. Validation and testing
4. Generalization to new data

## Applications

- Price prediction
- Customer churn forecasting
- Risk assessment
- Quality control

## Materials

- Lecture slides (PDF)
- Summary presentation (11 slides)
- Python examples
