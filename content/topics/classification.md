# Classification

Categorizing data into predefined classes.

## Overview

Classification algorithms learn decision boundaries to categorize new observations based on learned patterns.

## Algorithms

### Decision Trees
- Interpretable rule-based decisions
- Feature importance
- Handling mixed data types

### Random Forests
- Ensemble of decision trees
- Reduced overfitting
- Feature selection

### Support Vector Machines
- Maximum margin classifiers
- Kernel methods

## Evaluation

- Confusion matrix
- Precision, recall, F1-score
- ROC curves and AUC
