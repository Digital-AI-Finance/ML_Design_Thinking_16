# Responsible AI

Building AI systems that are fair, transparent, and accountable.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this topic, you will:
- Identify sources of bias in ML systems
- Apply fairness metrics and mitigation strategies
- Use SHAP for model explanations
- Design for accountability and transparency

## Prerequisites

- Classification and Supervised Learning
- Understanding of model evaluation
- Basic ethics concepts

## Key Concepts

### Bias in ML Systems
Sources of unfairness:
- **Data bias**: Unrepresentative training data
- **Algorithmic bias**: Model amplifies existing patterns
- **Measurement bias**: Flawed outcome definitions

### Fairness Metrics
- **Demographic parity**: Equal positive rates across groups
- **Equalized odds**: Equal TPR and FPR across groups
- **Individual fairness**: Similar people get similar predictions

### Explainability with SHAP
- Feature importance at individual and global levels
- Additive explanations based on game theory
- Visualization of feature contributions

## When to Use

Responsible AI practices are essential when:
- Decisions affect people's lives
- Protected attributes are involved
- Regulatory compliance is required
- Building trust is important

## Common Pitfalls

- Treating fairness as a one-time check
- Optimizing for single fairness metric
- Ignoring intersectionality
- Conflating correlation with discrimination
- Not involving stakeholders in design
