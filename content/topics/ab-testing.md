# A/B Testing

Statistical experimentation for data-driven decisions.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this topic, you will:
- Design valid A/B experiments
- Calculate required sample sizes
- Analyze results with statistical rigor
- Avoid common experimentation pitfalls

## Prerequisites

- Basic statistics (mean, variance)
- Hypothesis testing concepts
- Understanding of p-values and confidence intervals

## Key Concepts

### Experiment Design
1. Define hypothesis and metrics
2. Calculate sample size for power
3. Randomize assignment
4. Run experiment for planned duration
5. Analyze and interpret results

### Statistical Analysis
- **Null hypothesis**: No difference between variants
- **p-value**: Probability of result under null
- **Confidence interval**: Range of plausible effects
- **Effect size**: Magnitude of difference

### Sample Size Calculation
Depends on:
- Minimum detectable effect (MDE)
- Statistical power (typically 80%)
- Significance level (typically 5%)
- Baseline conversion rate

## When to Use

A/B testing is appropriate when:
- Changes can be randomized fairly
- Sufficient traffic for statistical power
- Metric is measurable and relevant
- Time allows for proper experiment

## Common Pitfalls

- Stopping experiments early (peeking)
- Running multiple tests without correction
- Ignoring network effects
- Small sample sizes
- Wrong randomization unit
