# Clustering

Discovering natural groupings in data without predefined labels.

## Overview

Clustering algorithms find structure in unlabeled data by grouping similar observations together.

## Algorithms Covered

### K-Means Clustering
- Iterative centroid-based algorithm
- Choosing optimal k with elbow method
- Strengths and limitations

### DBSCAN
- Density-based clustering
- Handling arbitrary shapes
- Noise detection

### Hierarchical Clustering
- Agglomerative approach
- Dendrograms for visualization
- Cutting strategies

## Applications in Design Thinking

- Customer persona development
- Market segmentation
- Behavior pattern discovery
- Survey response grouping

## Materials

- Lecture slides (PDF)
- Python notebooks
- Case studies
