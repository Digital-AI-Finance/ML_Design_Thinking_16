## Overview

Unsupervised learning finds hidden structure in unlabeled data, enabling discovery of natural groupings, patterns, and relationships.

## Key Techniques

### Clustering
- Grouping similar data points
- K-means, hierarchical, DBSCAN

### Dimensionality Reduction
- PCA for feature compression
- Visualization of high-dimensional data

### Association Rules
- Finding relationships between items
- Market basket analysis

## Applications in Innovation

- Customer segmentation discovery
- Anomaly detection
- Pattern mining
- Data exploration
