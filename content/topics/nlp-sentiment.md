# NLP & Sentiment Analysis

Extracting meaning and emotion from text data.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this topic, you will:
- Preprocess text data (tokenization, normalization)
- Build sentiment classifiers
- Use pre-trained embeddings and transformers
- Evaluate NLP model performance

## Prerequisites

- Supervised Learning concepts
- Basic text processing concepts
- Understanding of classification metrics

## Key Concepts

### Text Preprocessing
1. **Tokenization**: Split text into words/subwords
2. **Normalization**: Lowercase, remove punctuation
3. **Stop word removal**: Filter common words
4. **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reduce to root form

### Sentiment Analysis Approaches
- **Rule-based**: Lexicons with sentiment scores
- **Machine Learning**: Train on labeled examples
- **Deep Learning**: Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa)

### Word Embeddings
Dense vector representations:
- Word2Vec, GloVe (static embeddings)
- BERT (contextual embeddings)

## When to Use

Sentiment analysis is valuable for:
- Customer feedback analysis
- Social media monitoring
- Brand perception tracking
- Product review summarization

## Common Pitfalls

- Ignoring domain-specific vocabulary
- Not handling negation ("not good")
- Overlooking sarcasm and irony
- Using general models on specialized text
- Ignoring class imbalance in training data
