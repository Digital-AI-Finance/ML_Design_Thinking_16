# Machine Learning Foundations

The starting point for understanding how machines learn from data.

## Overview

This topic introduces the fundamental concepts of machine learning, including:

- Types of learning (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement)
- The learning journey from data to predictions
- Model training and evaluation basics
- Overfitting vs underfitting

## Key Concepts

### The Learning Paradigm
Machine learning enables computers to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed for each task.

### Bias-Variance Tradeoff
Understanding the balance between model complexity and generalization ability.

### Cross-Validation
Techniques for robust model evaluation and selection.

## Materials

- Lecture slides (PDF)
- Hands-on exercises
- Discovery worksheets
